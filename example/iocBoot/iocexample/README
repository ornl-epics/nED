Default st.cmd file imports detectors configuration from a file called
detectors. This is of the same format as st.cmd and any valid EPICS shell
command can be put in there. However the file has been split for easy detector
configuration with the help of DiscoverPlugin. When the detectors setup is not
known or needs to be update, use 'Global discover' button in DiscoverPlugin.
Then select 'substitution format' output mode and copy&paste discovered modules
into detectors.substitution file in this directery. Run `make detectors' and
the configuration is complete.
